# Neural Networks and Learning Machines
- Perceptron convergence algorithm implementation
  - classification of linear separable classes C1 and C2
  - first generalisation: drop precondition of linear separability
      - hierarchical recursive model
  - second generalisation: allow classes C1, .., Cn
  - third generalisation: drop fixed number of classes?
